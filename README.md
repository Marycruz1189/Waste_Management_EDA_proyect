# Waste_Management_EDA_project


##### "The development of societies and population growth, among other things, influence the increase in municipal solid waste generation.  The world's population is growing by leaps and bounds, projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, 9.7 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100 (United Nations, 2019).Similarly, global environmental indicators show that more waste is being generated over time, creating environmental problems in urban ecosystems, especially because of the challenge faced by governments in the management and disposal of such waste. According to a report presented by the World Bank in 2017 (2018), 2010 million tonnes of MSW are generated annually in the world, and an important fact to highlight is that at least 33% of this waste is managed at risk to the environment. Therefore, the hypothesis of this project is: Population growth and economic development generate an increase in the production of solid waste."
